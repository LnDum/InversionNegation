# InversionNegation

In the Data folder, you’ll find all the data for each participant. There is a file per session. Depending on the subject, there is one, two or three files (if their sessions were back to back there was no need to exit a session and start a new one).

The code is a .rmd with explanations of what we did at each step (and a pdf of the Rmarkdown).

'SujetsFaceMatch' is a table with the participants’ information (age, sex, Benton and FrAct score…)
