Descritpion
There are two folders : Analysis and Data.
The analysis folder contains the analysis code as .rmd with explanations of what we did at each step (and a pdf of the Rmarkdown).
There are also the .rsd for the model used in the final analysis.
A table with the participants’ information (age, sex, Benton and FrAct score…)
In the Data folder, you’ll find all the data for each participant. There is a file per session. Depending on the subject, there is one, two or three files (if their sessions were back to back there was no need to exit a session and start a new one).
